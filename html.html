            <li><b>Learn Basic Tags:</b> HTML uses tags to define different elements on a webpage. For example, the
                &lt;h1&gt;
                tag
                defines a heading, while the &lt;p&gt; tag defines a paragraph.</li>
            <li><b>Structure Your Page:</b> Every webpage needs a basic structure, including the &lt;html&gt;,
                &lt;head&gt;,
                and &lt;body&gt; tags. The &lt;head&gt; contains information like the page title, while the &lt;body&gt;
                contains the visible content.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Makes Perfect!</b> The best way to learn HTML is by doing. Find online tutorials with
                exercises or create your own simple webpage. There are also online playgrounds where you can
