        <p>Ready to unleash your inner web designer? Here's a breakdown of essential CSS concepts to get you started:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Selectors:</b> These target the elements you want to style, like headings, paragraphs, or specific

                values in pixels (px) or
